# Machine Translation

This directory contains an implementation of a machine translation task using `fairseq` tool set. We use [Mizan](https://github.com/omidkashefi/Mizan) dataset which is a parallel corpus between English and Persian. We then use different methods like BLEU and Comet to evaluate the translator models.
