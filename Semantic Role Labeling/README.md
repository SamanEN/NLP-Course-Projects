# Semantic Role Labeling

This directory contains implementation of different neural networks for the role of semantic role labeling. Unfortunately due to ambiguities of the description document, the last part was left unfinished.

## Data

There is small dataset put next to the notebook. Also note that for the code to work, you need to download the GloVe 6b 50d from [here](https://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip) and put it in the `./glove` directory relevant to the notebook.
